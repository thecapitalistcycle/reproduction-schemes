# Marx on Activity Analysis

The actual circuit of industrial capital in its continuity is therefore
not only the unity of the processes of circulation and production but
also the unity of all its three circuits. But it can be such a unity only if
all the different parts of capital can go through the successive stages of
the circuit, can pass from one phase, from one functional form to
another, so that the industrial capital, being the whole of all these
parts, exists simultaneously in its various phases and functions and
thus describes all three circuits at the same time. The succession [das
Nacheinander] of these parts is here governed by their co-existence [das
Nebeneinander], that is to say, by the division of capital. In a ramified
factory system the product is constantly in the various stages of its
process of formation and constantly passes from one phase of produc-
tion to another. As the individual industrial capital has a definite size
which depends on the means of the capitalist and which has a definite
minimum magnitude for every branch of industry, it follows that its
division must proceed according to definite proportions. The magni-
tude of the available capital determines the dimensions of the process
of production, and this again determines the dimensions of the com-
modity capital and money capital in so far as they perform their func-
tions parallel with the process of production. However co-existence,
by which continuity of production is determined, is only due to the
movement of those parts of capital in which they successively pass
through their different stages. Co-existence is itself merely the result
of succession. If for instance C—M' stagnates as far as one part is con-
cerned, if the commodity cannot be sold, then the circuit of this part
is interrupted and no replacement by its means of production takes
place; the succeeding parts, which emerge from the process of produc-
tion in the shape of C, find the change of their functions blocked by
their predecessors. If this lasts for some time, production is restricted
and the entire process brought to a halt. Every stagnation in succes-
sion carries disorder into co-existence, every stagnation in one stage
causes more or less stagnation in the entire circuit of not only the
stagnant part of the capital but also of the total individual capital.
The next form in which the process presents itself is that of a succes-
sion of phases, so that the transition of capital into a new phase is
made necessary by its departure from another. Every separate circuit
has therefore one of the functional forms of capital for its point of de-
parture and point of return. On the other hand the aggregate process
is in fact the unity of the three circuits, which are the different forms
in which the continuity of the process expresses itself. The aggregate
circuit presents itself to every functional form of capital as its specific
circuit and every one of these circuits is a condition of the continuity
of the total process. The cycle of each functional form is dependent
upon the others. It is a necessary prerequisite for the aggregate proc-
ess of production, especially for the social capital, that it is at the
same time a process of reproduction and hence a circuit of each one of
its elements. Various fractional parts of capital pass successively
through the various stages and functional forms. Thanks to this every
functional form passes simultaneously with the others through its own
circuit, although always a different part of capital finds its expression
in it. One part of capital, continually changing, continually repro-
duced, exists as a commodity capital which is converted into money;
another as money capital which is converted into productive capital;
and a third as productive capital which is transformed into commod-
ity capital. The continuous existence of all three forms is brought
about by the circuit the aggregate capital describes in passing
through precisely these three phases.

Capital as a whole, then, exists simultaneously, spatially side by
side, in its different phases. But every part passes constantly and suc-
cessively from one phase, from one functional form, into the next and
thus functions in all of them in turn. Its forms are hence fluid and
their simultaneousness is brought about by their succession. Every
form follows another and precedes it, so that the return of one capital
part to a certain form is necessitated by the return of the other part to
some other form. Every part describes continuously its own cycle, but
it is always another part of capital which exists in this form, and these
special cycles form only simultaneous and successive elements of the
aggregate process.
The continuity — instead of the above-described interruption — of
the aggregate process is achieved only in the unity of the three cir-
cuits. The aggregate social capital always has this continuity and its
process always exhibits the unity of the three circuits.
The continuity of the reproduction is at times more or less interrupt-
ed so far as individual capitals are concerned. In the first place the
masses of value are frequently distributed at various periods in un-
equal portions over the various stages and functional forms. In the
second place these portions may be differently distributed according
to the character of the commodity to be produced, hence according
to the particular sphere of production in which the capital is invested.
In the third place the continuity may be more or less broken in those
branches of production which are dependent on the seasons, either on
account of natural conditions (agriculture, herring catch, etc.) or on
account of conventional circumstances, as for instance in so-called
seasonal work. The process goes on most regularly and uniformly in
the factories and mines. But this difference in the various branches of
production does not cause any difference in the general forms of the
circular process.

Capital as self-expanding value embraces not only class relations,
a society of a definite character resting on the existence of labour in
the form of wage labour. It is a movement, a circuit-describing proc-
ess going through various stages, which itself comprises three differ-
ent forms of the circuit-describing process. Therefore it can be
understood only as motion, not as a thing at rest. Those who regard
the gaining by value of independent existence as a mere abstraction
forget that the movement of industrial capital is this abstraction in
actu. Value here passes through various forms, various movements in
which it maintains itself and at the same time expands, augments. As
we are here concerned primarily with the mere form of this move-
ment, we shall not take into consideration the revolutions which capi-
tal value may undergo during its circuit. But it is clear that in spite of
all the revolutions of value, capitalist production exists and can en-
dure only so long as capital value is made to create surplus value, that
is, so long as it describes its circuit as a value that has gained inde-
pendence, so long therefore as the revolutions in value are overcome
and equilibrated in some way. The movements of capital appear as
the action of some individual industrial capitalist who performs the
functions of a buyer of commodities and labour, a seller of commodi-
ties, and an owner of productive capital, who therefore promotes the
circuit by his activity. If social capital experiences a revolution in
value, it may happen that the capital of the individual capitalist suc-
cumbs to it and fails, because it cannot adapt itself to the conditions of
this movement of values. The more acute and frequent such revolu-
tions in value become, the more does the automatic movement of the
now independent value operate with the elemental force of a natural
process, against the foresight and calculation of the individual capi-
talist, the more does the course of normal production become subser-
vient to abnormal speculation, and the greater is the danger that
threatens the existence of the individual capitals. These periodical rev-
olutions in value therefore corroborate what they are supposed to re-
fute, namely, that value as capital acquires independent existence,
which it maintains and accentuates through its movement.
This succession of the metamorphoses of capital in process includes
continuous comparison of the change in the magnitude of value of the
capital brought about in the circuit with the original value. If value's
acquisition of independence of the value-creating power, labour pow-
er, is inaugurated by the act M—L (purchase of labour power) and
is effected during the process of production as exploitation of labour
power, this acquisition of independence on the part of value does not
re-appear in that circuit, in which money, commodities, and elements
of production are merely alternating forms of capital value in process,
and the former magnitude of value is compared with capital's present
changed magnitude of value.
