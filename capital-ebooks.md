# Ebooks of five volumes of capital, C0, C1-C3 and C4

I have verified that each of C1-C3 is the Penguin edition, with properly linked General Index, despite misleading cover pictures for C2 and C3.

Epub version more convenient for phone. Use FBReader. Also available free for all platforms:

Can use Calibre software to convert from epub to other formats, including both pdf and html (in zip file).

## C0 "Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy"

### C0.0 "Introduction"

Peking publication together with the preface to C1-1 here:

### C0 "Outline ..."

Same arranged more directly in same sequence as manuscripts titled "Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy (Rough Draft of 1857-58)" in two volumes of MECW (each of which has a subject index). This translation benefited from the previous work done by Martin Nicolaus and is said to be an improvement.

## C1 Capital Volume 1

### C1-0 "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. Part One"

Edition 0,  pp 257-417 in MECW 29 above. Indexed as part of same volume.

### C1 Capital Volume 1

The work generally known as "Capital" is the (German) edition 4 of Volume 1. As edition 4 is the final and "standard" we refer to it as C1 not C1-4.

All 4 editions are clearly identified as a continuation of C1-0 which identifies itself as the first part of C1.

**C1-1** is the first edition, which has some material omitted from C1.

**C1-F** is the 1872 French translation of edition 1, supervised by Marx and regarded by him as of independent value. Many but not all of the corrections by Marx were included in C1-4. At least one that was missed has been included as a footnote in the Penguin edition below.

This article argues that a translation of missing bits from French to English is needed:

### C1-1A "The Value Form" Appendix to the 1st German edition of Capital, Volume 1, 1867

https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/appendix.htm


Not listed, but linked from the appendix is the original chapter from (german) edition 1 that this was an appendix to:

### C1-1.1 "The Commodity"

https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/commodity.htm

The Penguin edition does not have either of these, but has:

### C1A "Appendix: Results of the Immediate Process of Production"

All 3 plus C1-0 should be listed as part of C1.

## C2

}

## C4 Theories of Surplus Value (parts 1-3)


This has all 3 parts (1173 pages) but appears to be from marxists.org with no indexes although it does have footnotes and is adequate for everything except the indexes. Better to get the 3 separate parts below.

Karl Marx-Theories of Surplus Value. 1-3-Progress Publishers (1968).pdf

@book{book:1298850,
   title =     {Theories of Surplus Value},
   author =    {Karl Marx},
   publisher = {Progress Publishers},
   isbn =      {},
   year =      {1968},
   series =    {},
   edition =   {},
   volume =    {1-3},
   url =       {http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=e3c8f76aa25143b7110cc745e2ec3260}
}

This page has links to better original copies for all three parts:

http://www.marx2mao.com/M&E/Index.html

Part 3 has subject index for all 3 parts.

**ToDo**

Now just need to extract text from pdf and convert the index from part 3.
