# Epub versions of three volumes of capital, C1-C3 plus Grundrisse, C0

I have verified that each of these is the Penguin edition, with properly linked General Index for C1-C3, despite misleading cover pictures for C2 and C3.

Epub version more convenient for phone. Use FBReader. Also available free for all platforms:

Can use Calibre software to convert from epub to other formats, including both pdf and html (in zip file).

## C4

**ToDo** Find online copies of each of the three parts of Theories of Surplus Value that include a general index.

My recollection is that marxists.org did not include the index so will need to extract from pdf of Moscow editions (Progress Press, FLPH etc)
