# Epub versions of three volumes of capital, C1-C3 plus Grundrisse, C0

I have verified that each of these is the Penguin edition, with properly linked General Index for C1-C3, despite misleading cover pictures for C2 and C3.

Epub version more convenient for phone. Use FBReader. Also available free for all platforms:

Can use Calibre software to convert from epub to other formats, including both pdf and html (in zip file).

## C4

**ToDo** Find online copies of each of the three parts of Theories of Surplus Value that include a general index.

My recollection is that marxists.org did not include the index so will need to extract from pdf of Moscow editions (Progress Press, FLPH etc)

Meanwhile, this does have all 3 parts (1173 pages) but appears to be from marxists.org with no indexes although it does have footnotes and is adequate for everything except the indexes.

Karl Marx-Theories of Surplus Value. 1-3-Progress Publishers (1968).pdf

@book{book:1298850,
   title =     {Theories of Surplus Value},
   author =    {Karl Marx},
   publisher = {Progress Publishers},
   isbn =      {},
   year =      {1968},
   series =    {},
   edition =   {},
   volume =    {1-3},
   url =       {http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=e3c8f76aa25143b7110cc745e2ec3260}
}

Hmmm **DONE**

http://www.marx2mao.com/M&E/Index.html

Has all 3 (under 1862-63)

Part 3 has subject index for all 3 parts.

Now just need to extract text from pdf and convert the index from part 3.
