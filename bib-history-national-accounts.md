## General Introduction - Chapter 1
...

It is worth noting that Book II comprises Marx's final thoughts on
capital, for the various drafts Engels used were composed more
than five years after the draft of Book III (1865). It follows that
thoughts developed in Book II may well have to be taken into
account when evaluating Book 111.8

### INFLUENCE OF CAPITAL II

Some comments on the influence of Book II on Marxian and ortho-
dox economic theory would be appropriate here. However, as the
material for this might cover a chapter or even a full book in itself,
we merely provide some references to the literature. As we have
already indicated, it was Part Three of the book that had the most
impact, whereas the other two parts were rather neglected.9

As to Part Three (on the 'macroeconomic' departmental division
and reproduction schemes) we may mention four main lines of
influence. They all arose in the first decades of the twentieth
century. The first author to adopt Marx's reproduction schemes in
his own work back in 1895 was Tugan-Baranowski, and he subse-
quently influenced orthodox approaches to the business cycle.
Within this line we also have the construction of orthodox macro-
economics and growth theory. to The work of Kalecki deserves
special mention, as in many respects his work is within the Marxian
tradition: certainly Marx's reproduction schemes influenced his ap-
proach to economics.ll The second line is within Marxian econom-
ics where Hilferding and Luxemburg were among the first to adopt
the analysis.12 A third, and rather surprising, line is the adoption of
the schemes in the USSR economic planning of the 1920s.13
However from this line there is a direct link to the last one, input -
output analysis. Leontief, a Soviet emigrant to the USA, founder of
this approach within orthodox economics for which he was granted
a Nobel prize, apparently got the idea from his Soviet education.14
(The above is merely a preliminary guide for the interested reader,
and the list of references in the notes is not meant to be exhaustive.)

### Notes

...

8. A concise source in English on the various drafts for Capital is Oakley
(1983). Evidently it deserves reconsideration on the basis of the new
source material not available to Oakley.

9. We may mention just one exception: Moggridge (biographer of
Keynes and editor of his collected works) indicates that Keynes used
Marx's capital circuit approach in his 1933 lectures. See Moggridge
(1976: 104); Keynes (CW, XIII: 420); d. CW, XXIX: 81-2, where
Keynes writes on the same issue in the preparation of his General
Theory.

10. Damar in his seminal paper (1946), for example, refers to Marx. See
further the papers in Horowitz (1968), Mandel (1978), Howard &
King (1989) and Kurz (1995).

11. See Kalecki (1954: ch. 3 and 1968); d. Sawyer (1985: ch. 8).
Incidentally, according to Harcourt (1982: 270), Robinson over the
years came 'to prefer Kalecki's version of the central propositions of
the General Theory to Keynes's version because they are placed in the
context of Marx's schemes of reproduction and a theory of cyclical
growth'. According to her account, Robinson, after reading Volume
Two, liked to tease Harrod by telling him that his growth theory was
already there, in Marx's last chapter (Robinson, 1953: 17).
12. See Mandel (1978); and Howard & King (1989).
13. See, for example, Desai (1979: ch. XVII).
14. See Lange (1959: ch. 3); Jasny (1962); Stone & Stone (1977).
15. The passage criticised by Murray is in Mandel (1978). Incidentally
Mandel's claim there that Marx's Theories of Surplus Value is inconsis-
tent in its definitions is not true. The second quotation in Mandel's
note 43 is in truth a gloss on Smith's 'second definition', namely the
one under attack by Marx.
