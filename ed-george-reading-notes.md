## Ed George Reading Notes - EGRN


Main focus for now is to go carefully through EGRN starting in part 3 of C2.

https://readingmarx.wordpress.com/category/capital-volume-2/capital-volume-2-part-3-the-reproduction-and-circulation-of-the-total-social-capital/

Goals are:

1. Help Ed George improve them by fixing typos and suggesting other minor changes within the existing framework of explaining what Marx actually said.

2. Produce modern explanations of the underlying theory unconstrained by Marx's presentation of it. There could be many ways to do that, some of which are discussed below.

3. Prepare for extending the above explanations into an explanation of Maksakovsky's "The Capitalist Cycle". Again many possible ways.

The point is that the work is necessary because Marx's explanation of reproduction has never been widely understood but is essential for understanding the business cycle and related crises.

A major breakthrough was achieved by Ed George in re-writing Marx's account. This took a year's work. 
That work makes it possible to just reference the corresponding sections of EGRN instead of directly referencing the chapters in C2 which people simply won't read.

Nevertheless a lot of work remains to be done to provide the minimum comprehension necessary to prepare people for serious development of the theory of the capitalist cycle.

Maksakovsky's audience was a seminar on Marx's reproduction schemes at an institute of advanced studies (the "Institute of Red Professors" at the "Communist Academy").

That audience could reasonably be expected to only need the brief reminder as to what the reproduction schemes were about, 
given in the first five pages (pp49-52) of the core Chapter 2 in Maksakovsky's short report (144 pages).

No such expectation is plausible now.

It is necessary to download all the .pdf files listed in the links here (and desirable to simply collect all of them for all 3 volumes).

We skipped past the two files for .18 and .19 and started in the first of three files for .20.

Note that links for .pdf files are listed in reverse order at Ed George's blog.

We are currently still stuck at this first file but will eventually also finish the next two files for .20 and the single file for .21.

Total of 6 .pdf files at above link.

I think part of the problem that results in us being stuck at first file is that it is from chapter 20 of C2. 
We should have started earlier and read through **all** the files for C2:

In fact it would be better to start from beginning of C1:

That will have to be left until after a first attempt at just .20 and .21.

But meanwhile it is still essential to download the two glossaries for C1 and C2:

## Notes on Single Topics

I intend to respond to issues raised in discussion (and hopefully posted as "issues" in the issue-tracker here), with separate notes on each single topic.

These would include draft glossary entries, and spreadsheets as well as explanatory paragraphs.

I hope others will join in with their own draft notes and revisions of mine. The github facilities make it easy to just start writing or revising.
Read the Github help guides for more information.

Later these short topics could be linked into working papers, submissions to journals and books.

In the meantime preliminary linking can be done using the wiki.

## Orientation

My orientation will be towards eventually producing exploratory explanations and an interactive SFC ABM (Stock Flow Consistent Agent Based Model).

This would be closely aligned with the SNA and related macroeconomic statistics and aimed at reaching people who could help take things further.

So I want to focus on spreadsheets that can be developed towards interactive models and glossary entries (and domain models)
that relate the concepts used by Marx to those in the SNA.

Hopefully if we reach people who can help, this can be taken further to interactive UML models and a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game.

To get to that point I believe it will be necessary to go beyond what Marx elaborated in C2 part 3 by including:

1. Stocks as well as flows.

2. Credit as well as gold commodity money.

3. Prices moving with imbalances in stocks when there are imbalances between demand and supply flows.

4. Physical as well as monetary quantities.

5. Multiple technologies.

6. Depreciation of fixed capital dominated by technological obsolescence.

7. Minimum scale for each technology.

8. Demand for labor power dominated by competition with automation.

9. Supply of labor power dominated by affordability of disposable free time.

10. Accumulation ("savings") dominated by income and time preferences.

11. Accumulation without an increase in labor force by moving to less labor intensive technologies as rate of profit declines.

12. Gestation delays for accumulation in "heavy" industry.

Above implies sublating the "transformation problem" and sets the stage for Maksakovsky's treatment of actual cyclical growth. But still within the C2 framework of imaginary "equilibrium", single closed economy (no imports and exports) and no state.

Although it sounds ambitious the work for all this has already been done by Marx. Harder part is extending it to emerging new technologies instead of just multiple technologies, multiple states in a world market, concentration and centralization of capital, changing organization of production and changes in mentality of each class. None of the hard aspects are listed above as they are for work after having got an audience for what should have been understood nearly a century ago.

## Citations

I will refer to Ed George's Reading Notes for Marx's Capital vol 2 Chapter
20 chunk 1 as EGRN C2.20-1.

(There are three files or "chunks" for Chapter 20)

p13 in chunk 1 of my copy has one "sketch". We will need a standard way to
refer to items as pagination may change with improvements. Hopefully we
will end up with a labelling system that links directly into diagrams
within subsections. Meanwhile I will use digits for the section and
subsection within a chapter, followed by a diagram number within a
subsection, ignoring the file or chunk number.

So C2.20-1 p13 is within C2.20.5.3:

"III The movement of money and the
realisation of commodity circulation".

That is within C2.20.5:

"5 The Mediation of the Exchanges by Monetary Circulation"

The first diagram on  p13 is also the first diagram in the section so I will label it as C2.20.5.3d1

There are 4 diagrams in that section, wirh d4 on page 14.

Short form to label the "sketch of money flow" while we know we are
discussing EGRN ch20 would be 5.3d1. Short label while we know we are
discussing diagrams within 5.3 is d1
