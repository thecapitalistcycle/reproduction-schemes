In C2.20.5.3 Marx overspecifies the dance of monetary movvements for commodity exchange as two particular fully ordered circuits A and B.

A has 3 exchanges.

B has 7.

EDGRN figure d1 provides an overview.

Concrete examples are needed but Marx's are too hard to follow.

In exploratory explanation, player (reader) should just select from recommended scenarios plus own variations and see simulation successively generating exchange steps within circulations.

Non Player Characters (NPCs) representing Biusinesses, Owners and Workers in the two departments perform actual exchanges subject to constraints fòr simple or expanded reproduction and starting scenario.

Constraìnts only impose a partial ordering of dance steps, not a fully determined choreography.

Hopefully could do this with simple spreadsheets. Add whatever is needed for clear explanation.

Perhaps constraint solver.

Perhaps animated UML sequence diagrams implementing Acivity Diagram constraints.
