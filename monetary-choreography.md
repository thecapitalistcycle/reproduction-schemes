In C2.20.5.3 Marx overspecifies the dance of monetary movements for commodity exchange as two particular fully ordered circuits A and B.

A has 3 exchanges.

B has 7.

EGRN figure d1 provides an overview.

Concrete examples are needed, but Marx's are too hard to follow.

In exploratory explanation, Player (reader) should just select from recommended scenarios plus own variations and see simulation successively generating exchange steps within circulations.

Non Player Characters (NPCs) representing Businesses, Owners and Workers in the two departments perform actual exchanges subject to constraints fòr simple or expanded reproduction and starting scenario.

Constraìnts only impose a partial ordering of dance steps, not a fully determined choreography.

Hopefully could do this with simple spreadsheets. Add whatever is needed for clear explanation.

Perhaps constraint solver.

Perhaps animated UML sequence diagrams implementing Acivity Diagram constraints.

## Total-order vs. Partial-order plan

•  A total-order plan

   –  specifies the temporal ordering constraint of every step in the plan
 
•  A partial-order plan

   –  specifies only those temporal orderings that must be established to resolve threats.

•  Example goal: purchasing milk and bread in a grocery store

   –  A total-order plan: a)topurchase milk first and to purchase bread, andb)topurchase bread first and to purchase milk.
 
   –  A partial-order plan does not specify the ordering constraint and defers the decision until when it is necessary.
