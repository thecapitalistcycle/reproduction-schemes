# Monetary Choreography

In C2.20.5.3 Marx overspecifies the dance of monetary movements for commodity exchange as two particular fully ordered circuits A and B.

A has 3 exchanges.

B has 7.

EGRN figure d1 provides an overview.

Concrete examples are needed, but Marx's are too hard to follow.

In exploratory explanation, Player (reader) should just select from recommended scenarios plus own variations and see simulation successively generating exchange steps within circulations.

Non Player Characters (NPCs) representing Businesses, Owners and Workers in the two departments perform actual exchanges subject to constraints fòr simple or expanded reproduction and starting scenario.

Constraìnts only impose a partial ordering of dance steps, not a fully determined choreography.

Hopefully could do this with simple spreadsheets. Add whatever is needed for clear explanation.

Perhaps constraint solver.

Perhaps animated UML sequence diagrams implementing Acivity Diagram constraints.

Business Process Models have diagrams for specifying the protocol constraints for a series of coordinated steps in a business collaboration such as an exchange ie purchase and sale.

## Total-order vs. Partial-order plan

•  A total-order plan

   –  specifies the temporal ordering constraint of every step in the plan
 
•  A partial-order plan

   –  specifies only those temporal orderings that must be established to resolve threats.

•  Example goal: purchasing milk and bread in a grocery store

   –  A total-order plan: a) to purchase milk first and to purchase bread, and b) to purchase bread first and to purchase milk.
 
   –  A partial-order plan does not specify the ordering constraint and defers the decision until when it is necessary.

## Stocks and Flows

Difficulty is related to confusion concerning stocks, flows and turnover.

Earlier chapters of C2 go into this thoroughly.

But.20 is mainly simplified to discuss only flows (annual turnover).

Introduction of fixed capital in .20.11 and .21 requires separation of stocks (EGRN C2.20 part 3 and C2.21).

The monetary choreography also needs starting and ending stocks of cash (which can be zero), equalized by the two monetary circuits A and B.

Introducing stocks also connects with "Consumption of Fixed Capital", "Revaluation", "Gross Fixed Capital Formation" and "Changes in Inventory" in SNA.

Yamaguchi System Dynamics diagrams could be helpful.
