Above is a comprehensive history. Section 1.8 p21-24 pdf 47-50 is important for widespread misunderstanding of Marx. Acknowledges that "Marxist" insistence on excluding services as unproductive was not what Marx actually said, but confuses the issue anyway. Bizarre considering how much Marx emphasized that labor power is a commodity. Shows importance of explicitly treating services (and also durable consumer goods as counterpoint). Includes useful correlation of Marx's terms with modern terms but also some confusion worth clarifying. Appears to be without actual reference to v2! Also worth reading a lot of the rest.

1.8c defines the following correspondence between terms used by Marx and those used in modern (1958) National Accounts.

References are exclusively to C4 and C3.49 despite the fact that C3.49 refers to C2.

Highlights incomprehension of variable capital eliminating constant capital except for depreciation. That absurdity  is ignored below to give a more accurate correspondence that would probably be understood by users of current SNA whereas in 1958 they still had not acquired input-output tables.
