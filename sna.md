_Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide_

The methodology and concepts described in the Manual are consistent with other macroeconomic data sets,
including the System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA), the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM
2014), and the publication by the United Nations and the European Central Bank of the handbook on Financial
Production, Flows and Stocks in the System of National Accounts. This consistency underscores the close rela-
tionship existing between the different macroeconomic statistical systems.

Chapter 14: The supply and use tables and goods and services account

14.2 Term "product" now used instead of "commodity" for both flow and balance.

14.4 Product balance:

Turnover = productive consumption + consumption + accumulation

Output + imports = intermediate consumption + final consumption + capital formation + exports

Worth showing imports and exports even though set to 0 for now as will be needed later, for multiple local and 
regional as well as national tables with transport and trade margins. Will also need taxes and subsidies later.

14.5 Both sides at purchasing prices so add above extras to left side:

Output (at basic prices) + imports + trade margins + transport margins + taxes on products - subsidies on products = 
(at purchaser's prices)

intermediate consumption + final consumption + capital formation + exports

Again, we set these extras to 0 for now.

Chapter 28: Input-output and other matrix-based analyses

Also describes Social Accounting Matrix.
