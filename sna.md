Chapter 14: The supply and use tables and goods and services account

14.2 Term "product" now used instead of "commodity" for both flow and balance.

14.4 Product balance:

Turnover = productive consumption + consumption + accumulation

Output + imports = intermediate consumption + final consumption + capital formation + exports

Worth showing imports and exports even though set to 0 for now as will be needed later, for multiple local and regional as well as national tables with transport and trade margins. Will also need taxes and subsidies later.

14.5 Both sides at purchasing prices so add above extras to left side:

Output (at basic prices) + imports + trade margins + transport margins + taxes on products - subsidies on products = (at purchaser's prices)

intermediate consumption + final consumption + capital formation + exports

Again, we set these extras to 0 for now.
